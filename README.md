# What Do

## Introduction

What Do is a simple mapping application designed to store and search interesting
places and activities to do on vacation.

The primary goal of the app is to allow users to search by category and location.
Additionally, it will allow the creation of itineraries and randomized location
recommendation based on input limitations added by the user.

Another main feature will be the inclusion of videos featuring the location being
viewed. Users can add links to YouTube for videos which highlight a location so
others can get an idea what to expect when they go.

## Roadmap

The app should function very similar between desktop and mobile.
